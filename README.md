# bg-remover-source

## Overview

This background remover tool is designed to remove backgrounds from images using deep learning techniques. It utilizes the isnet_dis.onnx model to perform the background removal process.

## Obtaining the Model File

The `isnet_dis.onnx` model file used in this project is not included in the repository due to its large size. However, it is available upon request. If you need the model file, please feel free to contact me at [vickyBW@protonmail.com]. I'll be happy to provide it to you free of cost.

## Credits

This project is based on code found on the web. While I have made modifications to suit my needs, the core codebase was not developed entirely by me. Credit goes to the original author(s) for their work.
